Question    Explain the discretionary access control, 
mandatory access control, roll based access control in 
brief.
In brief, access control is used to identify an individual 
who does a specific job, authenticate them, and then 
proceed to give that individual only the key to the door or
workstation that they need access to and nothing more.
1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Discretionary Access Control is a type of access control 
system that holds the business owner responsible for 
deciding which people are allowed in a specific location, 
physically or digitally.
DAC is the least restrictive compared to the other 
systems, as it essentially allows an individual complete 
control over any objects they own, as well as the programs
associated with those objects.
The drawback to Discretionary Access Control is the fact 
that it gives the end-user complete control to set 
security level settings for other users and the 
permissions given to the end-user are inherited into other 
programs they use which could potentially lead to malware 
being executed without the end-user being aware of it.
2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Mandatory Access Control is more commonly utilized in 
organizations that require an elevated emphasis on the 
confidentiality and classification of data (ie. military 
institutions). MAC will typically classify all end users 
and provide them with labels that permit them to gain 
access through security with established security 
guidelines.
